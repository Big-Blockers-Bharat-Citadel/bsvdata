# Project Overview

**BlockData** is website which fetches the data of a .csv file through api and upload its data in **BSV Blockchain Network** which makes the data decentralised. The data of any rows in a .csv file can be accessed through their *rows index* and *transaction hash*.


## Project Status

[Website](https://block-data.netlify.app/) [Under Development]


## Objective

1. The purpose of this project is to reduce the dependency on web2 ecosystem like use of central servers and database management system.
2. To demonstrate  the tech-enthusiast and developer that  how data-integrity and data-safety can be achieved by  leveraging the use of BSV(bitcoin satoshi vision).


## Methods Used

* Blockcahin as De-centralised database.
* Smart-contract.
* Java-script(Just for fetching data and show  it to the client side)
* API for retriving data and other information and serve to the frontend.
* HTML,CSS for Rendering data to the client in an organised way.

## Technologies

*  BSV(Bitcoin Satoshi Vision)
*  Scrypt
*  SMART-CONTRACT
*  Java-script
*  API(Application programming interface)..
*  HTML
*  CSS



## Project Description

This whole Web3 app on which we are working on can be broken into TWO components.

1. Transaction in blockchain ,in layman language injection of  data  into block and then finally feeded into blockkchain.
This whole process has been achieved by making use of SMART-CONTRACT, which is written in scrypt(Turing-complete programming language for BSV).


2. Data Fetching and serving information to the client  with the use of API in this case we have use WhatsOnChain ,which is specially for BSV.
A.We have used the the java-script  just for  writing logic  and handling API information .
B.HTML for providing skeleton to the webpage.

## Needs of this project

- Full-stack developers.
- Data verification and validation organization.
- Hosting data on BSV with less fee among all service providers of web2 ecosystem.
- Financial service otganization.
- Gaming & gambling.
- Government & organizational governance.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo.

2. Use our SMART-CONTRACT for entering data annd make transaction .
[WARNING : Data which you are entering  should have perfect schema,this is particular  for this app because ,this app is made for specific purpose].

Example : [Col1 col2 col3 Prev_transaction_hash](Data of 1 row)
